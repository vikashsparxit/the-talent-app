**Optional branches:** Digital form and assessment steps are skipped when the job is not configured to require them.

## Handoff table

| Step | Primary actor | Others involved | Key surfaces |
|------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Apply** | Applicant | — | `/careers`, `/careers/:id`; creates candidate with source tracking |
| **Pending Approval** | Recruiter / HR | — | `/hiring?view=board` — first column; approve → Screening, or decline with reason |
| **Digital application form** | Applicant (recruiter fallback) | HR configures question bank | Applicant portal form; pipeline badges; Pre-Screen drawer section; `form_sent_at` visible to all recruiters |
| **Assessment** | Applicant | Recruiter assigns; HR/admin override on fail | `/evaluations`, exam portal `/exam/:id`; job pass gating on `/hiring?view=board` |
| **Pre-screen** | Recruiter / HR | Applicant may have submitted form already | Pre-Screen dialog; screening notes in candidate drawer |
| **Interview rounds** | Interviewer | Recruiter schedules; HR oversight | `/hiring` board stages, `/calendar`, `/my-interviews`, feedback gate |
| **Hire** | HR / Admin | Recruiter often initiates | **Mark as Hired** on pipeline card; terminal stage |

## Role ownership summary

| Role | Owns |
|------|------|
| **Recruiter** | Day-to-day candidate movement on assigned jobs; assign assessments; schedule interviews; pre-screen; digital form on behalf |
| **HR** | Full pipeline visibility; eval overrides; assessment advance override; org settings (limited tabs) |
| **Interviewer** | Feedback only — no pipeline advance, no eval override |
| **Admin** | Tenant config — users, email, assessments builder, system rules |
| **Applicant** | Apply, complete form/assessment when assigned, maintain profile |

## Failure and rework paths

| Situation | Default behaviour | Escalation |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| **Assessment not passed** | Recruiter blocked from advancing stage (if job has pass gating) | Admin or HR can override via advance dialog on `/hiring?view=board` |
| **Assessment expired / not started** | Recruiter assigns or re-invites from Evaluations or pipeline card | HR reviews in `/evaluations` |
| **Digital form incomplete** | Pipeline badge shows pending; scheduling may warn | Recruiter completes on behalf from candidate drawer, or applicant completes in portal |
| **Declined at Pending Approval** | Card moves to declined area; reason stored | Sourcing visibility only — no automatic re-entry |
| **Overdue interview feedback** | Mandatory feedback gate blocks interviewer app | Chitragupta nudges internal users (`source = chitra`) |
| **Interview no-show** | Interviewer submits No-Show verdict | Recruiter reschedules or rejects from pipeline |
